⚡ This README is **GitHub-ready**:  
- Includes **charts (mermaid)**  
- **GIF placeholders** for demo & banner  
- **Mind map** for workflow  
- Clean **tech-stack tables**  

👉 Just replace `https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/00000000/...` with your own screenshots/GIF links.  

Do you want me to also **make GIFs/screenshots automatically** for your repo (homepage, cart, etc.) so you can directly upload them?
